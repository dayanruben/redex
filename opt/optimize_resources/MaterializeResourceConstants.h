A pass that replaces all instructions of the form `sget vx, Lsome/path/R$sometype;.SomeResourceId:I`
with `R_CONST vx, #I` where #I is the literal value of that ID inlined into the instruction. This helps
with dead resource tracking as Redex now tracks which instructions point to resource IDs.

Note that this pass also simplifies the clinit of all R$ classes to resolve the static values of their fields.
